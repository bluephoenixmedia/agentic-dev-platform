# Implementation Plan for: Develop Coding Agent

## High-Level Plan: Developing the Coding Agent

This plan outlines the development of the "Coding Agent" platform based on the provided design document, focusing on a human developer's perspective and leveraging LangGraph and OpenHands.  The plan emphasizes iterative development and risk mitigation.

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Agent Setup (4 weeks)**

1. **Environment Setup:**
    * Set up development environments for all developers, including necessary dependencies (LangGraph, OpenHands, LLMs API keys, Git integration).
    * Configure a shared development repository containing the design document (as markdown or similar), prompt templates, and initial project structure.
    * Establish a robust testing framework (unit, integration, end-to-end) to validate agent functionality and data integrity.

2. **LangGraph Orchestration:**
    * Implement the core LangGraph workflow to manage agent interactions and state transitions.  Focus on checkpointing, error handling, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms.
    * Design and implement the graph data structure representing the development process (phases, tasks, subtasks).  Ensure efficient persistence and retrieval of graph states.

3. **OpenHands Workspace:**
    * Integrate OpenHands to provide the sandboxed execution environment (`/workspace`).  This involves setting up the mount point and ensuring secure access controls.
    * Implement basic functionality for file manipulation, command execution, and log streaming within the OpenHands workspace.

4. **Initial Agent Implementation (Documentation & Planning):**
    * Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) for a "Documentation" agent and a "Planning" agent. These will handle initial design document parsing and roadmap generation from the design document's specifications.
    * These agents will serve as prototypes to validate the core LangGraph/OpenHands interaction.  Their outputs will be thoroughly reviewed before proceeding to more complex agents.

**Phase 2: Coding & Testing Agents (6 weeks)**

1. **Coding Agent Development:**
    * Develop the "Coding Agent," focusing on a specific coding task type initially (e.g., implementing a simple function based on a clear specification).
    * Implement robust prompting strategies to guide the LLM, including clear instructions, examples, and constraints.
    * Integrate code quality checks (linters, formatters) into the agent's workflow.
    * Implement diff generation and human review mechanisms for code changes proposed by the Coding Agent.

2. **Testing Agent Development:**
    * Develop the "Testing Agent" to automatically generate and execute unit and integration tests based on the generated code.
    * Integrate test results into the LangGraph workflow, providing feedback to the Coding Agent and triggering potential rework.
    * Implement reporting mechanisms to track test coverage and success rates.


**Phase 3: Advanced Agents & Refinement (6 weeks)**

1. **Advanced Agent Implementations:**
    * Develop agents for architecture, CI/CD, and log analysis based on the design document's specifications.
    * Implement advanced features like incremental development, refactoring support, and error recovery within the coding agent.
    * Develop and integrate security measures to prevent unauthorized access and actions.


2. **Performance Monitoring and Optimization:**
    * Implement metrics tracking (cycle time, test pass rate, etc.) to monitor agent performance.
    * Identify bottlenecks and optimize agent workflows for speed and efficiency.


3. **Refinement and Iteration:**
    * Iteratively refine agents based on testing and feedback.  This involves improving prompt engineering, enhancing error handling, and optimizing the LangGraph orchestration.
    * Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of developers to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.


**Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance (2 weeks)**

1. **Deployment:**
    * Deploy the Coding Agent platform to a production-ready environment.
    * Implement monitoring and alerting to ensure system stability and identify potential issues.

2. **Maintenance and Support:**
    * Establish a maintenance plan to address bugs, add new features, and update dependencies.
    * Provide ongoing support and training for users of the Coding Agent platform.


This plan is iterative and adaptable.  Regular reviews and risk assessments are crucial to ensure the project stays on track and meets its objectives. The focus on MVPs for each agent minimizes risk and allows for continuous feedback integration throughout the development process.  Thorough testing at each phase is paramount to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
