# Implementation Plan for: Implement Human Approval Gates for Destructive Actions

## Plan: Implementing Human Approval Gates for Destructive Actions in Agentic Developer Platform

This plan outlines the implementation of human approval gates for destructive actions within the Agentic Developer Platform, leveraging LangGraph for orchestration and OpenHands for the execution workspace.  The focus is on security and maintainability.

**Phase 1: Define "Destructive Actions" and Approval Workflow (1 week)**

1. **Identify Destructive Actions:**  Create a comprehensive list of actions considered "destructive." This includes but isn't limited to:
    * Deletion of files or directories.
    * Overwriting files without version control backup.
    * Database schema modifications (dropping tables, altering data).
    * Deployment to production environments.
    * Running potentially unsafe code (e.g., arbitrary code execution).

2. **Design Approval Workflow:**  Define the process for human approval. This should include:
    * **Trigger:**  Specify which actions trigger the approval process.
    * **Notification:**  Determine the notification method (email, Slack, in-app notification). The notification must clearly present the action, its potential consequences, and the affected resources.  Include clear instructions on how to approve or reject.
    * **Approval Mechanism:**  Choose a secure method for approval (e.g., a dedicated approval UI within OpenHands, secure webhooks, two-factor authentication).
    * **Timeout:**  Establish a timeout for approvals to prevent indefinite delays.  Define a fallback mechanism (e.g., automatic rejection after a specified duration).
    * **Logging:**  Ensure detailed logging of all approval requests, approvals, rejections, and timeouts.

3. **Integration Points:**  Identify the specific points in the LangGraph workflow where the approval gates need to be inserted.  This will likely involve creating custom LangGraph nodes.

**Phase 2: Implement Approval Gate Mechanism (2-3 weeks)**

1. **LangGraph Node Development:** Create a new LangGraph node ("ApprovalGateNode") responsible for:
    * Receiving the request for a destructive action (including all relevant context: user, action type, affected resources).
    * Generating and sending an approval request using the defined notification method.
    * Receiving the approval response (approve/reject).
    * Updating the LangGraph state based on the response.  If approved, proceed with the destructive action; if rejected, log the rejection and halt the workflow.
    * Handling timeouts and fallbacks.

2. **OpenHands Integration:**  Integrate the ApprovalGateNode with OpenHands. This might involve:
    * Creating an approval UI within OpenHands.
    * Implementing secure communication between LangGraph and OpenHands.

3. **Agent Adaptation:** Modify the relevant agents to incorporate the ApprovalGateNode into their workflows.  Each agent proposing a destructive action must invoke the `ApprovalGateNode` before execution.

**Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (1-2 weeks)**

1. **Unit Testing:** Thoroughly test the `ApprovalGateNode` in isolation, ensuring it correctly handles all scenarios (approvals, rejections, timeouts, errors).

2. **Integration Testing:**  Test the integration between the `ApprovalGateNode`, LangGraph, and OpenHands.  Simulate various destructive actions and verify that the approval process works as expected.

3. **End-to-End Testing:**  Perform end-to-end tests involving multiple agents and a complete workflow, including triggering, notification, approval, execution (or rejection), and logging.

4. **Refinement:** Based on testing results, iterate on the design and implementation to address any issues or improve the user experience.

**Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring (1 week)**

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the updated LangGraph and OpenHands components to the production environment.

2. **Monitoring:**  Monitor the approval process for performance, errors, and unexpected behavior.  Analyze logs to identify potential problems and areas for improvement.

**Throughout the entire process:**

* Maintain detailed documentation.
* Follow secure coding practices.
* Adhere to the existing version control and CI/CD pipeline.
* Regularly review and update the design document.


This plan provides a high-level framework. The exact implementation details will depend on the specifics of LangGraph, OpenHands, and the existing Agentic Developer Platform architecture.  The timeline is an estimate and might need adjustments based on the complexity and available resources.
