# Implementation Plan for: Develop Documentation Agent

## Plan for Developing the Documentation Agent

This plan outlines the steps a human developer would take to build the Documentation Agent, based on the provided design document.  The focus is on the Documentation Agent specifically, leveraging the broader Agentic Developer Platform's architecture.

**Phase 1: Understanding the Requirements (1-2 days)**

1. **Deep Dive into the Design Document:** Thoroughly review sections 1 and 2 (Executive Summary, Goals & Non-Goals) to fully grasp the overall platform vision and the specific role of the Documentation Agent.  Pay close attention to the interaction with LangGraph (orchestration) and OpenHands (execution environment).
2. **Define Agent Scope:** Clearly define the responsibilities of the Documentation Agent. This includes:
    * **Reading and parsing the design document:** Extracting information, such as task descriptions, dependencies, and relevant sections.
    * **Generating documentation:** Creating various documentation formats (e.g., Markdown, API docs, user guides) based on the design document content.
    * **Maintaining documentation consistency:** Ensuring the documentation remains synchronized with changes in the design document.
    * **Handling documentation updates:** Updating the documentation based on changes proposed by other agents (e.g., coding agent, testing agent).
    * **Responding to queries about the design document:** Answering questions about the system's architecture, functionality, and implementation details.
3. **Identify Data Sources and Outputs:** Determine the input (design document) and output (various documentation formats) for the agent.  Consider the format of the design document (e.g., Markdown, JSON) and the desired documentation formats.

**Phase 2: Design and Implementation (5-7 days)**

1. **Choose a Programming Language:** Select a suitable language (e.g., Python) based on its ecosystem (LangChain, libraries for LangGraph and OpenHands integration), developer familiarity, and performance requirements.
2. **LangGraph Integration:**  Implement the agent's logic within the LangGraph framework. This includes defining the agent's state transitions, checkpoints, and interaction with other agents via LangGraph's communication mechanisms.
3. **OpenHands Integration:** Develop the necessary code to interact with the OpenHands workspace. This involves mounting the `/workspace`, accessing files (the design document), and potentially generating documentation files within the workspace.
4. **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft the prompts to guide the LLM in extracting information from the design document and generating documentation. This may require iterative refinement through experimentation. Consider using modular prompts to enhance maintainability and reusability.
5. **Documentation Generation Logic:** Implement the core functionality for generating documentation in various formats. This might involve leveraging libraries for Markdown processing, API documentation generation (e.g., Sphinx, Swagger), etc.
6. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to ensure the agent's reliability and facilitate debugging.  Log actions to comply with the auditability requirements.
7. **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the agent functions correctly and reliably interacts with LangGraph and OpenHands.

**Phase 3: Integration and Refinement (3-5 days)**

1. **Integration Testing:** Integrate the Documentation Agent with other agents (e.g., planning, coding agents) within the larger platform. Test the end-to-end workflow to identify and resolve any integration issues.
2. **Performance Tuning:** Optimize the agent's performance by identifying and addressing bottlenecks in processing and documentation generation.
3. **Refinement based on Feedback:** Iterate on the agent's design and implementation based on feedback from testing and integration with other agents.  Pay close attention to the quality and completeness of the generated documentation.
4. **Security Review:** Conduct a security review to ensure the agent adheres to the platform's security and governance requirements. This includes minimizing exposure of sensitive information and implementing appropriate access controls.


**Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring (1-2 days)**

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the Documentation Agent to the Agentic Developer Platform's runtime environment.
2. **Monitoring and Observability:** Set up monitoring to track the agent's performance (response times, error rates), usage patterns, and the quality of generated documentation. This will help identify areas for future improvement.


This plan provides a high-level overview.  The actual timeline and effort required will depend on the complexity of the design document, the desired documentation formats, and the specific features implemented.  Iterative development and continuous testing are crucial for success.
