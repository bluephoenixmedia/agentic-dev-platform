# Implementation Plan for: Develop Planning Agent

## High-Level Plan: Developing the Planning Agent

This plan outlines the development of the Planning Agent within the Agentic Developer Platform, leveraging LangGraph for orchestration and OpenHands for the execution environment.  The plan emphasizes iterative development and rigorous testing.

**Phase 1: Setup and Core Functionality (Weeks 1-3)**

1. **Environment Setup:**  Set up development environments for all team members, including necessary software (LangGraph, OpenHands, chosen LLM API client).  Establish version control (Git) and a project structure.  This includes configuring API keys securely.

2. **LangGraph Integration:** Develop the basic LangGraph orchestration for the Planning Agent.  This includes defining the agent's initial state, transitions, and checkpointing mechanisms.  Focus on error handling and robustness.

3. **OpenHands Integration:**  Establish communication between the LangGraph orchestrator and the OpenHands workspace. This involves creating functions to read/write files, execute commands, and stream logs within the sandboxed environment.  Prioritize secure access control.

4. **Basic Planning Logic:** Implement a rudimentary planning algorithm. This initial version can be simple, perhaps breaking down a high-level task (from the design document) into a list of sub-tasks based on keyword analysis and predefined heuristics.  No sophisticated dependency tracking or resource allocation is needed yet.

5. **Unit Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for the core functionality of the Planning Agent, focusing on the LangGraph interactions, OpenHands communication, and the basic planning algorithm.


**Phase 2: Enhanced Planning and Refinement (Weeks 4-6)**

1. **Advanced Planning Algorithm:**  Implement a more sophisticated planning algorithm. This might involve techniques like dependency analysis, resource allocation, and task prioritization. Consider incorporating aspects of critical path analysis for optimal scheduling.

2. **Design Document Parsing:** Develop a robust parser for the design document (likely using structured data representation in the design document, JSON or YAML).  This parser should extract relevant information for planning, such as task descriptions, dependencies, and priorities.  Implement robust error handling for malformed documents.

3. **LLM Integration for Planning:** Integrate the chosen LLM to enhance the planning capabilities.  The LLM can be used for tasks like generating more detailed subtasks, suggesting alternative approaches, and assessing task complexity.  Prompt engineering is crucial here.

4. **Integration Testing:** Perform integration tests to verify the interaction between the Planning Agent, LangGraph, OpenHands, and the LLM.  Focus on edge cases and error handling.


**Phase 3:  Robustness, Security, and Observability (Weeks 7-9)**

1. **Security Hardening:** Implement robust security measures, including input validation, output sanitization, and access control mechanisms to prevent vulnerabilities.  Thoroughly review all external interactions (LLM API, file system access).

2. **Observability and Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track the Planning Agent's performance, identify bottlenecks, and facilitate debugging. Use structured logging for better analysis.

3. **Error Handling and Recovery:** Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure the agent can gracefully handle unexpected situations and resume operations after failures.

4. **End-to-End Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end tests simulating realistic development scenarios.  This includes testing the complete workflow from design document parsing to task execution and results reporting.


**Phase 4: Deployment and Iteration (Weeks 10+)**

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the Planning Agent to a staging environment for further testing and refinement.

2. **Feedback and Iteration:** Gather feedback from users (developers) and iterate on the agent's capabilities based on real-world usage patterns.  Prioritize features based on user feedback and observed performance bottlenecks.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Integrate the Planning Agent into the overall CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment and automated testing.

This plan outlines a structured approach to developing the Planning Agent. The timeframe is an estimate and can be adjusted based on development velocity and identified challenges.  Regular code reviews and thorough testing at each stage are crucial for success.
